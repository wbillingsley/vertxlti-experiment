## Vertx LTI 1.3

### 

This is an experimental repository, looking to create a simple set of LTI 1.3 integrations
that can be run in a Vertx server.

It is written for Scala 3. The thought of using vertx for this is that it is very similar
in style to Scala 3, but as Vertx is a Java library, there is not the delay that occurs
waiting for versions of Play or Akka HTTP to come out for a new version of Scala
